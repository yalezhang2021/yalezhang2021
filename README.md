#**Previous Work**
___________________
##1.Comparison of radar simulation tools in the automotive field##
  
with the development of millimeter wave circuit technology, the technologies in automotive field such as advanced driver assistant system (ADAS) and automated driving (AD) have also further developed. In the autonomous driving revolution, automotive radar sensors enable to detect environment around the car, and improve driving safety. 
This work is focused on the following three simulation tools, CARLA, MATLAB, and the Radar Ray Tracing Simulator.
